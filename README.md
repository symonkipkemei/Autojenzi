***Building Material Metrics in Real time!***

 
## 📋 Summary

![Ribbon](src/Addin/Resources/Ribbon.png)

There are many factors that influence the design outcome of your construction project 👷‍♂️ .
Building Material data may not be one them despite contributing up to 70% of the total 
construction cost.

Is material data an afterthought when you are designing 🤔 ?

Not any more! Autojenzi has a solution for you. In real-time ⏳ , you can now access your 
building materials data as you design.

Hypothetically, The enclosing building elements such as floor, roof and walls in BIM Models
are devoid of Material context when designing using BIM tools. As a result, the decision of 
which building materials to be used are inferred late in the project and thus little impact 
during the design phase.

Autojenzi simplifies the process into three steps:
1. Select your building technology 
2. Apply the building technology to selected elements
3. Abstract building materials and element quantities

Starting off with walls -you can now apply a building technology of your preference and break it down 
into subsequent materials in real-time. 


## 📦 Some feature include:

- Abstract both element and material quantities in real time
- Comperatively compare between different building technologies
- Simulate cost comparisons between various technologies in real time.
- Export element and material quantities into pdf
- Integrate	quantities export wit excel.


## 📦 Future updates will include:

 -  Extend the functionality to other building elements: roofs,slab, columns and beams
 -  Integrate with a web app for more information on building technologies
 -  Enrich the building technology database


 ## ⌨️ Usage Guide

Below is a illustration on how the tool works. Enjoy!
